A **Sankey diagram** (or energy flow diagram) is commonly used to visualize energy transfers in a system. In the case of a **refrigeration cycle**, it effectively represents:  

- **Work input** to the system  
- **Heat extracted** from the refrigerated space  
- **Heat rejected** to the surrounding environment (kitchen)  

## **Energy Flow Breakdown**  

### **Refrigeration System**  
The refrigeration system can be represented as a box with the following energy flows:  

- **Input Arrow (Work):**  
  - An arrow entering the refrigerator labeled:  
    - **Work = 3600 kJ**  

- **Cooling Effect Arrow:**  
  - An arrow representing heat extracted from the refrigerated space:  
    - **\( Q_C = 6000 \) kJ**  

- **Condenser Output Arrow:**  
  - An arrow representing heat rejected from the refrigerator to the kitchen:  
    - **\( Q_H = 8000 \) kJ**

### **Kitchen System Diagram**  
To visualize the overall effect on the kitchen environment:  

- A larger box labeled **"Kitchen"** encapsulates the refrigerator system.  
- Inside the kitchen:  
  - The **refrigerated space loses 6000 kJ** of heat.  
  - The **condenser delivers 8000 kJ** of heat back into the kitchen.  
- **Net Effect:** The overall internal energy of the kitchen **increases by 2000 kJ** (since \( 8000 - 6000 = 2000 \) kJ).
